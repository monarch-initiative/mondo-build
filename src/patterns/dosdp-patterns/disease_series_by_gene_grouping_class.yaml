pattern_iri: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mondo/patterns/disease_series_by_gene_grouping_class.yaml

description: 'This pattern is for grouping classes that group diseases that are caused by a single mutation in a single gene. Examples include OMIM classes that are a part of a phenotypic series (such as children of MONDO_0015229 'Bardet-Biedl syndrome' and gene-based grouping classes from ClinGen.  Examples: [peroxisome biogenesis disorder due to PEX7 defect](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0100272)
